                to keep medium2 a safe and respectful space, there are a few simple rules to follow. don&apos;t post anything hateful, abusive, or offensive — let&apos;s keep things positive. plagiarism is a no-go, so make sure whatever you write is your own.
                <br/><br/>
                if you use someone else&apos;s content, give them proper credit. no spam or promotional junk — this isn&apos;t a marketing site. 
                <br/><br/>
                respect others&apos; opinions, even if you don&apos;t agree with them. breaking these rules may lead to your content being removed or your account being blocked. basically, just be kind, be original, and use this space to share something meaningful.
